## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query
### What I learned

Here I learned about proper use of color palatte.

Code snippets, see below:

```css
.container{
    width: 23%;
    height: 75vh;
    margin: 105px 601px 28px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
}

.el1 span{
    font-family: "inter";
    font-size: 15px;
    color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [FlexBox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) - This helped me for changing the flex direction to column. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
